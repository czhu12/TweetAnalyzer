After just one season, the Vancouver Canucks have had enough of head coach John Tortorella and will be firing him on Thursday, per a report from TSN and reporter Ferhan Lalji. While the news comes as a bit of a surprise given the fact that he was hired less than a calendar year ago, fans in Vancouver will be celebrating with joy come Thursday afternoon.


After winning a Stanley Cup in Tampa Bay a decade ago, Torts has bounced around the NHL with his longest and most recent stint being in New York with the Rangers. But after a tumultuous 2013 season, Tortorella’s players revolted and he was forced out and fired.

Vancouver scooped up Torts with the hope that he’d be able to jump start the veteran players the Canucks have but instead the season was a disaster. Not only did the Canucks miss the postseason by an embarrassing margin, but Tortorella managed to get himself suspend in the middle of the year for trying to fight the entire Calgary Flames team after a heated game.

The fact that the Rangers, who hired former Canucks coach Alain Vigneault, are into the Conference Semifinals likely didn’t help Torts’ cause in juxtaposition and Vancouver’s wasted 2013-14 season has caused the team to move aggressively towards immediate change.
